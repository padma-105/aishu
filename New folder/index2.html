    <h5>Places to Go</h5>
    <p>Since Metro Cities airport is at a distance from the city, we recommend getting a self-drive car rental in
      Bangalore as soon as you land. You can drive straight to your business meeting, or if you’re here for leisure,
      head to the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens for a bit of greenery and fresh air. While there isn’t a lot to see within
      the city, do take out some time for a few museums and markets. The real appeal of Bangalore lies in its proximity
      to hill stations and national parks.

      You can use one of Revv’s self-drive cars in Bangalore to enjoy the 5-hour journey along SH17 to Madikeri or
      Coorg. Or, take the Mysore highway to drive to the Queen of the Hills, Ooty. Driving enthusiasts who are up for a
      challenge can even tackle the winding road that leads to Coonoor, which sits nestled in the evergreen Nilgiris.
      Those aching for a taste of thrill and awe can visit the Bannerghatta, Nagarhole or Bandipur national parks, all
      of which are a short drive away from the city.
    </p>
    <h5>Selecting a Car</h5>
    <p>When you opt for a Revv car rental in Bangalore, you have the option of selecting the car of your choice. Our
      wide fleet has a number of compact hatchbacks that are ideal for daily city drives, comfortable sedans that can be
      used for short trips out of the city, and spacious and tough SUVs that are best suited for long trips to hill
      stations.
    </p>

    <h5>Rent a car from Revv</h5>
    <p>In Bangalore, Revv is the preferred self-drive car rental service, thanks to our wide range of flexible
      offerings. When you rent from us, you choose whether you want to rent a car for a day, a week, or a month.

      If you’re ready to start your next adventure, download the Revv app and book your self-drive car in Bangalore
      today. We’ll deliver it right to your doorstep and pick it up from a location of your choice, even if that’s
      another city where Revv has an office.
